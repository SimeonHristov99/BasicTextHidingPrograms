# BasicTextHidingPrograms

Written in C++ during my first year of programming.

--OpenText: Removes words.

--OpenSentences: Remove whole sentences.

Mark words with * and the program will replace them with 15 _'s. It will also display the removed words in a random order above the screen.

How To Use:

1. Create a text file on your desktop.
2. Paste the text you want to format with the program.
3. Format the text so that it is one whole paragraph.
4. Mark the words which you want to remove with the symbol: " * ".
5. Open the program and paste the text.
